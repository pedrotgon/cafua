# Google’s AI Agent Bake Off 2025 — Retail Banking Challenge

## 1. Introduction

The **Google AI Agent Bake Off 2025** is a competition where teams must design and implement multi-agent systems that solve modern retail banking challenges.
Participants will receive a mock backend and frontend for **Cymbal Bank**, a mock Cymbal Bank AI Agent, and Gemini API keys.
The goal is to reinvent digital banking with **multi-agent systems** using the **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** and **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol**.

---

## 2. Challenge Overview

### Context

Retail banks face two big issues:

1. **Fractured Customer Experience**

   * Customers encounter unhelpful chatbots.
   * They often get irrelevant responses or are redirected to call centers where they must repeat themselves.
   * This manual, inefficient workflow creates frustration.

2. **Surface-Level Relationship**

   * Most interactions are purely transactional (check balance, pay bill).
   * Banks miss chances to create deeper, proactive financial relationships.

### Mission

Build a multi-agent system that:

1. **Offers seamless human-like interactions**

   * UI should be intuitive and engaging.
   * Include one-time setup at login, clear controls for managing permissions.

2. **Offers proactive guidance**

   * Analyze spending patterns to help with major financial goals.

3. **Automates with intelligence**

   * Go beyond answering questions: automate workflows and resolve issues proactively.

## 3. Agent Types & Examples

### 3.1 Daily Spending Agent

This agent will help the user to identify opportunities to save
and automate their daily expenses. It has access to your frequent purchases like
coffee, grocery shopping, monthly subscriptions. Example questions and actions:

* "How am I tracking my 'dining out' budget for this month?"
* "I want to save an extra $100 this month. Where can I cut back?"
* "Based on my spending and income, how much can I realistically save each month?"
* "Are there any cashback offers for my recent purchase at [Retailer]?"
* "I'm going to the supermarket. Are there any relevant coupons or discounts on my credit cards? Great, apply to my credit card."
* "Can you find any subscriptions I might not be using?"
* "Remind me before my free trial for [Service Name] ends."
* "Are there any family plans available for my current subscriptions that could save me money?"

### 3.2 Big Purchases Agent

This Agent will help the user in budgeting and planning for big
purchase items. Think about buying a home, buying a car, planning how much to spend
for rent. Example questions and actions:

* "How much house can I realistically afford based on my income and savings?"
* "What would my estimated monthly mortgage payment be for a $400,000 house with a 20% down payment?"
* "How much do I need to save for a 10% down payment and closing costs in []?"
* "Create a savings plan to have a down payment ready in 3 years."
* "How much can I qualify for a home? What can I do for more money?"
* "What other debts should I pay off before taking on a large loan?"

### 3.3 Trip Budget Planning Agent

This Agent will help the user in budgeting and planning
for vacations and trips. Example questions and actions:

* "I want to go to Italy in 9 months. How much do I need to save each month?"
* "Set up a vacation fund and let's track my progress."
* "Where can I cut my daily spending to save more for this trip?"
* "Automate a transfer of $150 to my vacation savings every payday."
* "Are there any hotel discounts or package deals for my travel dates?"
* "Do any of my credit cards offer travel rewards or perks I can use for this trip?"
* "Alert me if the price of a flight to [Destination] drops below $500."

Do you want me to now **append our current multi-page, two-agent-per-page implementation plan** to the end of this Markdown so you have the PDF context *and* your build blueprint in one document? That way, the other AI will have both the challenge details and your current solution approach.
